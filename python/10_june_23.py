# Functions

def my_function():
# Define a function def follow by a name 
# Name is followed by () for defining parameters and :
# The body of the function is the set of instructions that we want to run when the function is called and must be INDENTED

def greeting():
    print("hello")

greeting()
# by adding () after the function's name, we are invoking it or calling it 


# Return
# Allows us to return a value from a function
# return also immediately ends the function 

# Parameters
# Allow us to pass in arguments to our function 
# Arguments: values that occur in the place of the parameters at the time of execution 
# parameters act like local variables inside the body of a function, whatever we pass in as arguments take their place
